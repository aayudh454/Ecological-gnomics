### **Discussion format**
* Outline-20min time, Engaging activity, Use board effectively, Example from literature.

#### Advances in sequence Tech
* Human Genome project 2001-2003, Sanger, 15 years, 1genome, $3B
* AiSeqXTen-2014 Illumina, 1day, 45 whole genomes in a day, $100 each.

#### Range of Application
* Whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA seq, ChIP seq, targeted/ capture seq (design a probe) 
* Where is genetic variation Phenotypes?
* Number of samples 
* Comparative studies already modeled or not (1st thing to consider)
* Demographic activity, adaptive genetic variation, gene expression, length of the reads, 
* Number of reads (short 50bp, long 100, 150, 300 bp in MiSeq 10000-60000 SMRT; reads single vs paired end), distribution

#### General Library Prep workflow
* Extraction of DNA or RNA to cDNA
* Fragment sample
* Ligate adaptors
* Individual barcode
* Add seq adaptors
* PCR

#### Sequencing by synthesis (SBS)
* Bridge amp, cluster generation, labeled dNTP (ATCG)

#### Other technologies

#### Learning activity
