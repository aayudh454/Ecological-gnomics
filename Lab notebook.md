### Page 1: 2017-01-18. Ecological genomics, first class

### **Steve and Melissa's intro**    
* Introduction to transcriptomics. The goals of learning in this course. Lots of RNA seq analysis.
* Ecological genomics institute, KSU: emphasis on adaptation to environment   
* Gordon Research Conference: Integrating different levels of biological organization on any system. approach and tool focused! Field going towards new data and new analytic techniques  
* Intro to eco genomics, oxford press; Using technology to address ecological issues such as nutrient cycling, population structure, life history vairation , trophic interaction, stress responess, and adpatation to environmental change

### Page 2: 2017-01-23. The next-generation sequencing

### **Discussion format**
* Outline-20min time, Engaging activity, Use board effectively, Example from literature.

### Info update: Next generation sequencing 

#### Advances in sequence Tech
* Human Genome project 2001-2003, Sanger, 15 years, 1genome, $3B
* AiSeqXTen-2014 Illumina, 1day, 45 whole genomes in a day, $100 each.

#### Range of Application
* Whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA seq, ChIP seq, targeted/ capture seq (design a probe) 
* Where is genetic variation Phenotypes?
* Number of samples 
* Comparative studies already modeled or not (1st thing to consider)
* Demographic activity, adaptive genetic variation, gene expression, length of the reads, 
* Number of reads (short 50bp, long 100, 150, 300 bp in MiSeq 10000-60000 SMRT; reads single vs paired end), distribution

#### General Library Prep workflow
* Extraction of DNA or RNA to cDNA
* Fragment sample
* Ligate adaptors
* Individual barcode
* Add seq adaptors
* PCR

#### Sequencing by synthesis (SBS)
* Bridge amp, cluster generation, labeled dNTP (ATCG)

#### Other technologies

#### Learning activity

### Info update: Quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs)

#### What are QTN?
Identifying quantitative trait nucleotide; example trait-flowering time, flower color, venom potency, tolerance, defense compounds, toxin tol, drought tol, altitude tol.  

#### Quantitative genetic theory of adaptive traits 
* Va
* h2

#### Methods
* Linkage mapping
* GWAS
* Selection scan

### Page 4: 2017-01-30. Group presentations of project ideas

### Discussion on Sea Star RNA seq data set
  * one page proposal due in 2nd Feb
  
#### Our grop idea:
* Immune related gene expression
  * Reverse pathology
  * Looking specific classes of genes
  * A prior test of resistance genes
      * Compare individual that stayed healthy vs those got sick.
      * Looking at the sick to healthy transition.

##### We are looking the gene expression, up arms paper.
* H vs S (day 9, 12, 15)
* H vs H (day 9, 12, 15)
* S vs S (day 9, 12, 15)
